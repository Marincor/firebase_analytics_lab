# firebase_analytics_lab
> a lab project to implement firebase analytics in Angular Web App -

## Project Lab
The idea behind this project is to implement Firebase Analytics into an Angular web application. Firebase Analytics is a tool provided by Google that allows developers to track user behavior and gather data on their app's performance.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Have Angular CLI installed
### Installation
1. Navigate to the project directory and run npm i to install all the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a Firebase project and enable Analytics for it.
3. In the Firebase Console, find the configuration information needed to integrate Firebase into your app
4. Add the Firebase configuration to your environment.ts file.
## Usage
1. You can start tracking events in your app by calling the logEvent method provided by the SDK.
2. You can also set up user properties and user events to track user's behavior and demographics.
3. Run ng serve to start the project locally.
4. You can view the analytics data on the Firebase console. It will show you the number of users, sessions, and events, along with other metrics such as engagement, 5. retention, and crash-free users.
In addition, you can create custom reports and segment your data to get a deeper understanding of how users are interacting with your app.
## Insights
Overall, the goal of this project is to gain valuable insights into how users are interacting with your app and make data-driven decisions to improve its performance.
